The doors have locked, the employees have gone home, and the friends who came with you are nowhere to be seen.", "Take a nap.", "Call the police.", "Try to break a window.", "Loot the shops.", "You wake up the next morning and find that the mall has opened again. However, the security guard who found you looks very unamused.", "Your phone runs out of battery before you can explain the situation.", "You successfully escape.", "After hours of searching, you have plenty of valuable trinkets. You are still trapped in the mall, but at least you have plenty of new stuff... right? Unfortunately, the security cameras have caught your entire spree. The next morning, the authorities quickly confiscate all of your new possessions."]
